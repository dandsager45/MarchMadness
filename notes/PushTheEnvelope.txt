And runs it through a model of all teams & season data from 2003+ by taking the delta of team1's attributes minus team2's. 
This model is then run through a random forest using an 80/20 test/train split.

This is obviously just an example to get people started in creating a model. A few things stand out to me:
I don't like using the pure "SUM" of an attribute per game. This disregards Tempo, which I think may be an important factor in these models. 
It also does not directly use a game by game basis.
It does not take ANY strenght of schedule, nor how "good" the opponent is into account besides their season statistics. This can have major problems - visualize if I took the stats of a highschool and put it against one of these models. 
I also am not sure about using the delta of the teams as inputs, but I cannot figure out a better way to do so at first glance. Maybe there is a better way? Pass in all params from both teams? I will keep an eye on this in future 

Introduces two libraries to look at:
SKLearn for machine learning modeling in python
Seaborn for data visualization
