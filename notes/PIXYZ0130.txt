PIXYZ0130 - 【日本語&ENG】MMLM-Men' AutoLGBM baseline ゆっくり実況

~~General Observations~~ 3/29/22
First off, it is very interesting to see this submission. It is clearly performed by a team that has some asian descent, as it is in both English and (Chinese, Japanese?)
They give notes on why they are performing things, and it is VERY obvious that they are not familiar with basketball stats. They dont understand FGA & FGM

They point out worry that seed of each team may not be relevant with independent features. I like that already, I have had that thought for a while. 
They also notice that there are various rankings. They are taking the average for the time being.


They utilize LightGBM like the prior submission that I observed. It seems to have a neat chart which showcases feature importance. 
It shows that rankings are used quite heavily, and seeding not so much. 

Fold 5 Epoch 20000

They look to add more features, potentially taking ideas from others (Just like I'm doing right now!)

Doesn't look like they have a good model, only using averages over the season.
